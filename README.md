# webapp

Hello, I made this sample app. I created this app using programming languages such that python, flask and pywebio. <br>

Pywebio is a module in python that allow developers to create web application without using HTML and CSS, we can also use pywebio with flask,Djnago and other web frameworks.

Adding Jenkinsfile too, as if you have a jenkins cluster, just few tweaks in variables like `DEPLOY_HOST` and add your credentials in your Jenkins credentials manager with the given names in the file and you will be good to go
